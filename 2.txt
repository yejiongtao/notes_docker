1. environment-agnostic systems
	Docker has three specific features to help build environment-agnostic systems
		read-only file systems
			--read-only
			but sometimes the process needs some write privilege
				e.g. creating lock files
				use volumns to make that exception
					-v /run/lock/apache2/

		environment variable injection
			--env ENV_1='hello'
			-e ENV_2='hi'
				// one -e for each variable

		volumns

2. 


--restart
	never restart (default)
	attempt to restart when a failure is detected
	attempt for some predetermined time to restart when a failure is detected
	always restart regardless of the condition
